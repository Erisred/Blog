<h2>Legal</h2>

<b>Under construction, travel with care...</b><br />
I'm liberally applying some of wht I see on this page for now... https://www.artofmanliness.com/privacy-policy/

The information and output of this site is from the imagination of the author. Any advice or instruction (implied or otherwise) is pure fiction, and should not be followed or confused as being the beliefs of the author.</p>

<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>As of now, I don't collect anything, from anyone, as far as I know. This is a github-hosted site, not a commercial enterprise. I also do not use cookies, use ads, or track any traffic on this site.</p>
<p>This means I have no retention or reporting policies. Use at your own risk, as I do not know what GitHub Pages runs for analytics, monitoring, or collection practices on top of (underneath?) the site.</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>To be perfectly clear, the author of this site collects no user data, including the use of analytics for any purpose.</p>

<p>Links to other sites may be provided that are not operated by me. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third partyâ€™s site. It is advised to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. As such, I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services. External links are followed at the risk of the user.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, all content on this website is my own, including photos. I do make use of <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> quite often, and provide attribution on them</p>
<p>Any resemblance to the work of others is unintentional. Because I am human, it is possible a citation or attribution is unfortunately left unspecified. Please contact me if you have concerns of any kind.</p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>This policy may be updated at any time. Notification will be posted if or when this happens on the main page of the site.</p>
