# My attempts at time tracking
I tried out two time tracking apps, Clockify and Boosted. Here are my thoughts.

## Initial impressions
Both seem to have enough options to do what I need. I just need to adjust my concept of "Projcts" to mean something more akin to "Areas of focus" so I can group things together better. As far as platform, Clockify seems to work much better on desktop, while Boosted works *only* on mobile.

# First up - Clockify
So, initially I tried to set up broad areas of focus as projects, with tasks as subcategories:
- Work admin
	- Email roundup
	- Productivity
	- Project review
	- Travel time
- Work meetings
	- Department sync meetings (daily)
	- Department sync meetings (weekly)
	- Company meetings (daily)
-  Personal admin
	-  Grocery shop
	-  Meditate
	-  Productivity
	-  Rise and shine
	-  Sleep
	-  Weekly review
-  General tasks
	-  Chores
	-  Housework (maintenance, like putting up curtains, etc.)

This worked, but I found it difficult to *find* the project/task I wanted to allocate time to, so I switched it up a little. I used more general areas of focus to try to make it easier:
- Chores
	- Laundry
	- Groceries
- Idle time
- Reading
- Programming
- Curating my PKB
- Eating
- Getting ready
	- Bathroom, shower
- Work
	- Meeting
	- Actually working
- Sleep
- Driving

This way, even if I didn't allocate time to a specific task, I could generalize by project, which would get me most of the way there.

First off, I changed *Client* to *Category*, since I'm using this personally, not as a freelancer or as part of an organization. A stumble I had was figuring out *how* to use projects and categories. It really helped to think of the categories AS clients, as in the categories were Work, Home, Club, etc. That way, a project could be counted inside multiple categories.
I am not using tags (yet).
