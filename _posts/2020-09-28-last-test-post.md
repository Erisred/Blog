Sometimes I think Humpty might have been better off staying broken.

# When the bough breaks
There seems to be some debate over the intentions of Miss Muffet's spider. A common misconception is that the spider meant no harm to the young lady, when in fact the arachnid meant all kinds of ill will.

### Why did the spider sit beside her?
Well, there is no way a spider is going to take the chance of falling in the curds and whey, when there is a perfectly good tuffet to land on instead. I smell a conspiracy.

### She was scared enough to run away
I think we all know that spiders can cause us to do funny things. We flail our arms. We scream. We might even stand up. Would we really run away? To many, this is the nail in the coffin of this story. Such flagrant reactions are saved for the likes of bears and crocodiles, not spiders. Some of us might even instinctively reach out and swat it away, or simply squash it under our palms.

## And that is the end
No more spider to worry about. I rest my case.
