<h1>All about Erisred</h1>
<p>Here's the short version...</p>
<p>I'm a Minnesota native. I have an awesome family that I'm proud of. I also have a carreer that I'm <em>mostly</em> happy at, but <strong>definitley</strong> greatful for.</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>Music has always been my lifeblood; I almost need it to survive. The problem is that I tend to listen to stuff relatively few people in my life appreciate or care for, so I have to do it through headphones, or while driving myself somewhere.</p>
<p>A somewhat recent passion I've discovered is horses. Through my daughter and her 4-H club I have the opportunity to be around them quite a bit, and I can't get enough. My daughter has been leasing a horse since she was 8 or 9, and I'd honestly buy one if I could convince my wife to.</p>
<p>Some other random things I like... Coding, definitly. I'm not crazy creative, so I like to find something I like, deconstruct it, and rebuild it in my own style. Reading, for sure. I wish I had more time for reading - My tastes go from biographies to mysteries, but my first love is science fiction, and second is fantasy. I'll re-read almost anything by Asimov or Heinlein forever. Guitar - I played in high school, but did not keep up, nor did I build a good foundation, so I forgot alost everything. I've been picking it up here and there over the last few months.</p>
<p>I think that's a good start. I don't currently have any of my contact info or methods activated, but maybe someday I will. Curious and excited to see where this goes...</p>
<!--<p>I like to think I'm this big, scary metalhead type guy. Truth is, I have a great family, great job, and a nice house in the suburbs. I cut my hair years back - told myself it was time to "grow up" and live life in a normal way, with no more stereotyping or judgement. I miss the hair, but I still like the same music...
    Meanwhile, I discovered website design. I'm still trying to learn, and discovering there's a whole world of folks out there just like me who learned the language on their own. I'm not sure where this whole thing will go, but for now it's part journal, part repository for my learnings. More for me thanyone else, but if anyone can use the things I learn, so much the better. Pass it forward.
    By the way, I do like my music loud and heavy. \m/</p>
    <p>What started out as an obsession tinkering with a CMS named Tiddlywiki quickly grew into more. HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc ...and on down the rabbit hole. Eventually the things learned along the way were forgotten with time. This is an attempt to record things I learn, as well as resources, for a point of reference - one I suspect will only be used myself.</p>

    <p>Process Analyst
        Officially, I'm known as a Manufacturing Process Designer. Really, it's all because process analyst is too vague, and process engineer offends the actual engineers I work with. Everything started when I left my job as a mid-level manager for a pretty large midwest retail company (guess which one) for something with a set schedule. Enter manufacturing. Seven to four every day, paid overtime on weekends and holidays, not a bad gig - plenty of folks provide great lives for their families that way.
        
        What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Production planning, capacity management, data management, ERP systems analyst, process control, process analysis. Hobby web design, coding in general, javascript, css, avid social media lurker. Father, coach, cheeleader, pool boy. Horse leader, youth organization volunteer leader.
        
        My personal code of conduct
        I am a man, no longer a child. My choices reflect who I choose to be at this moment, for myself and those I hold dear. I no longer cater to others that I need to impress or placate in order to feel better. I make choices in order to better myself by my own standards, not anyone else's.
        
        I prefer to make mistakes of ambition, rather than sloth. I am, by nature, a thinker. This means I carefully calculate risk, but do so in order to act decisively. I prefer to make mistakes through action, rather than gain nothing by inaction.
        
        I have strong beliefs. These do not form a barrier to the beliefs of others. I will tolerate different points of view, and even challenge my own values as a result of my experiences.
        
        I do not know everything. I will value and seek out the experience of others, with no shame.
        
        I will be grateful for what I have during darker periods, grounded and compassionate during the high times.
        
        It is up to me to prove what I have to give to the world. I am the only person that can further my cause. This is true of status, income, and family.
        
        Every day is a new day, to be written as I see fit. I alone control how the events of today will affect me, and how I choose to react to them, if at all.
        
        I can have anything I desire if I can be brave enough to get it. Action cures fear.
        
        I will do it right, if it is worth doing at all.
        
        I will finish what I start.
        
        The inspiration for my personal code of conduct came from this article in Primer Magazine.
        Portions of the text have been plagiarized quite liberally, while others have been adapted to fit my life plan.
