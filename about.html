<h3>This site...</h3>
<p>...was started as a fun side project to learn Git, Jekyll, and how to combine both with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. I spent so much initial time making it look <i>just right</i> that I felt compelled to put something of value here.</p>
<p>As such, please be aware that there may be dead links, broken images, or thoughts that hang with promise but go... nowhere. I do this in my spare time as a hobby, posting things I learn. Mostly this knowledge is intended for myself, but hey, one never knows.</p>

<p>I'm a Minnesota native. I have an awesome family that I'm proud of. I also have a career that I'm <em>mostly</em> happy at, but <strong>definitley</strong> grateful for.</p>

<p>Music has always been my lifeblood; I almost need it to survive. The problem is that I tend to listen to stuff relatively few people in my life appreciate or care for, so I have to do it through headphones, or while driving myself somewhere.</p>

<p>A somewhat recent passion I've discovered is horses. Through my daughter and her 4-H club I have the opportunity to be around them quite a bit, and I can't get enough. My daughter has been leasing a horse since she was 8 or 9, and I'd honestly buy one if I could convince my wife to.</p>

<p>Random others... Coding, definitly. I'm not crazy creative, so I like to find something I like, deconstruct it, and rebuild it in my own style. Reading, for sure. I wish I had more time for reading - My tastes go from biographies to mysteries, but my first love is science fiction, and second is fantasy. I'll re-read almost anything by Asimov or Heinlein forever. Guitar - I played in high school, but did not keep up, nor did I build a good foundation, so I forgot almost everything. I've been picking it up here and there over the last few months.</p>

<p>I think that's a good start. Let's see what happens.</p>
