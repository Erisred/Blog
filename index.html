Hello, and thanks for stumbling across my small space. Although I do a little paid work in the work of computer science, it isn't my core function at work. As such, I have a couple of goals with this site.

<h2>Goal 1 - Document my journey with productivity</h2>

Like so many others these days, I've jumped headlong into productivity and became obsessed with it's methodology. Now, I'm no guru to any method, but I've tried enough of them to have a pretty good idea how they work.

<h2>Goal 2 - Document solutions I've found with technology</h2>

When I think of this, immediately my mind goes to coding. Of course I want to include snippets and hacks I've found helpful (most of which I steal from others through google searches). However, I realize that I do so many hacky things with programs becasue of my limited budget. Okay, not limited, I just try to find free or open source solutions when I can.
